## About
Via [23andMe](http://23andme.com/), here is my raw, uninterpreted genome SNP data (my DNA fingerprint).
Please fork and send pull requests fixing the bugs you might find. 

## Data
On the file `DNA.txt`, for each SNP, we provide its identifier (an rsid or an internal id), its location on the reference human genome, and the # genotype call oriented with respect to the plus strand on the human reference sequence. We are using reference human assembly build 37 (also known as Annotation Release 104).

On the file `mtDNA.txt`, you can find my `Mitochondrial DNA`.

## Further Work
This is a test bed for a new information encoding mecanism using Mitochondrial DNA.

Moreover, mitochondria evolved a unique mechanism which maintains mtDNA integrity through degradation of excessively damaged genomes followed by replication of intact/repaired mtDNA. This mechanism is not present in the nucleus and is enabled by multiple copies of mtDNA present in mitochondria
